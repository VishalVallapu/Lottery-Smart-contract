# Lottery-Smart-contract
This is a smart contract where minimum of 3 people are required to participate in the lottery and the winner is picked randomly thereby tranferring all the eth pooled will be transferred to the winner. I deployed this on test net using Metamask wallet by connecting it to Goerli and transferrring few fake ETH using Goerli faucet.
